This repository contains a project aimed at integrating n8n with Joplin using the Joplin API node wrapper created by rxliuli. This is a personal project, and as a non-developer, this is my first attempt at building anything with Node.js. The project is functional and suits my current workflow, so I decided to share it with others.

As the project progresses, I will continue to extend its functionality and implement all the capabilities of the Joplin API provided by rxliuli. Please excuse the code quality, as I am using this project to learn Node.js, GitHub, and modern coding practices in general.

I would like to thank the n8n team for creating a great piece of software, the Taiga node in particular, as I dissected it mercilessly to understand how nodes work. Additionally, I want to express my gratitude to Joplin for its existence and rxliuli for providing a well-documented API.
